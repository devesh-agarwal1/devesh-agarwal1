- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Devesh Agarwal @devesh-agarwal1
-Iâ€™m, a Solution Architect with over 17 years of experience in the ever-evolving telecommunications industry. Iâ€™ve spent my career diving deep into Core Network Elements like SDM, HLR/HSS, AUSF_UDM, 5G EIR, SDL, and One-NDS, delivering solutions that power millions of subscribers worldwide.

Beyond my day-to-day, Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast constantly expanding my skill set. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring the exciting worlds of DevOps, Python programming, and Cloud Computingâ€”because thereâ€™s always something new to learn in tech, right? Whether it's automating workflows, scripting solutions, or tinkering with cloud infrastructure, I love getting my hands dirty with the latest tools and technologies.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve built expertise in multi-cloud integration, infrastructure platforms (bare-metal, virtualized, and containerized environments), and monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana. Oh, and Iâ€™m pretty handy with AWK, SED, GIT, and diagramming tools like Visio and Draw.io.

When Iâ€™m not working or learning, youâ€™ll find me sharing insights, experimenting with new ideas, or connecting with like-minded techies. If you're as passionate about technology as I am, letâ€™s exchange notes and build something amazing together! ðŸš€
